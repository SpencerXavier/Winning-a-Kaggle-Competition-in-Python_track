Process: problem -> data -> model -> submisssion -> leaderboard [查kaggle 如何寫成CV]
composition: train data [we need to label them] + test data 
```

1. Explore train data 
```
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Read train data
train = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

# Look at the shape of the data
print('Train shape:', train.shape)

# Look at the head() of the data
print(train.head())
```

2. Explore test data
```
import pandas as pd

# Read the test data
test = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

# Print train and test columns
print('Train columns:', train.columns.tolist()) 
print('Test columns:', test.columns.tolist())

ps. .columns is an attribute, show columns names of dataframe
ps. .tollist() is a method
ps. Remember, that the test dataset generally contains one column less than the train one. 
    This column, is presented in the sample submission file. [output]
